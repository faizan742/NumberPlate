Number Plate Detection and OCR System
Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a number plate detection and recognition system using the YOLOv8 object detection model and OCR techniques. The entire system was tested and run on a Python backend, with model training on Kaggle and deployment in a Docker container locally.

Workflow Breakdown
1. Model Training (YOLOv8)
    â€¢ Platform Used: Kaggle
    â€¢ Library: Ultralytics YOLOv8
    â€¢ Purpose: Train a custom object detection model to localize number plates in vehicle images.
    â€¢ Export: The trained weights were exported as a .pt file (e.g., best.pt) from Kaggle to local disk for further use.

2. Local Setup for Inference
    â€¢ Development Environment: Python 3.10
    â€¢ Virtual Environment: .venv activated
    â€¢ Library used for object detection: ultralytics
    â€¢ OCR libraries tried:
        â—¦ pytesseract (Tesseract OCR engine)
        â—¦ easyocr (final working solution due to better accuracy)
Key Python Libraries:
    â€¢ ultralytics: For YOLOv8 object detection
    â€¢ cv2 (OpenCV): For image processing (cropping, grayscaling, filtering)
    â€¢ pytesseract: For OCR using Tesseract engine
    â€¢ easyocr: Lightweight and more robust OCR engine
    â€¢ re: For regular expression matching and cleanup of OCR results
    â€¢ os: For filesystem operations (saving debug crops)

System Flow
    1. Load Image: Input image is read using OpenCV.
    2. Detect Number Plate: The YOLOv8 model identifies bounding boxes around number plates.
    3. Crop the Number Plate: The cropped section is processed using OpenCV filters (grayscale, threshold).
    4. OCR Processing:
        â—¦ Initially tried with pytesseract, but OCR results were inconsistent or missing.
        â—¦ Switched to easyocr which successfully recognized plate numbers.
    5. Post-processing:
        â—¦ Cleaned OCR results (remove unwanted characters, spaces).
        â—¦ Regex used to validate patterns (e.g., letters followed by digits).
    6. Output:
        â—¦ Plate numbers printed in terminal.
        â—¦ Debug image crops optionally saved for inspection.

Docker Consideration
When running in a Docker container:
    â€¢ GUI functions like cv2.imshow() or cv2.destroyAllWindows() will fail unless additional GUI support is installed.
    â€¢ This was handled by removing GUI-related lines to avoid crashes.
    â€¢ The final system was terminal-based, outputting OCR results via print().

Final Working Code Highlights
import easyocr
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
...
ocr_results = reader.readtext(cropped_plate_img, detail=0)
Sample Output:
ðŸ§ª EasyOCR Output: ['LEC', '5855']
ï§¼ Cleaned OCR: LEC 5855
âœ… Plate 0: LEC 5855

Summary
    â€¢ YOLOv8 effectively detects number plates.
    â€¢ EasyOCR provided the most accurate OCR results.
    â€¢ GUI-free setup was essential for Docker compatibility.
    â€¢ Final result accurately extracted real-world number plate: LEC 5855
